# CRNNCGAN-OnFacialData

In this Project, there is a improvement on basic CGAN, which combine the RNN to basic CGAN structure, to have a better fit to time series trainning data.

The following shows you the structure of the model that used in this project.

This project shares you a basic structure and concept, all the parameters, features, and setting need to be changed to fit your applications.
